                <div class="section-title">LOVE</div>
                Love is a gentle breeze, whispering through the heart's meadow,
                A dance of shadows and light, where dreams and reality flow.
                It’s the first light of dawn breaking through the dark of night,
                A tender touch, a silent vow, bathed in soft moonlight.
                <br>
                Love is the echo of laughter shared beneath the stars,
                The warmth of a simple glance that heals all of life’s scars.
                It’s a timeless waltz, a story penned with an endless ink,
                Where souls entwine and hearts align in a symphony of sync.
                <br>
                In love's embrace, every heartbeat sings a symphony divine,
                A melody of moments that eternally entwine. </div>
            <div class="column">
                <div class="section-title">HIS EYES</div>
                   His eyes are a quiet ocean at dusk,  
                   Reflecting the soft hues of twilight’s blush.  
                   Stars weave tales in their depths so deep,  
                   Where secrets and dreams silently sleep.
                   <br>
                   They sparkle like the morning dew,  
                   Holding the promise of skies so blue.  
                   In their gaze, a universe unfolds,  
                   With stories of wonder and wisdom untold. </div>
            <div class="column">
                <div class="section-title">HIS SMILE</div>
                   His smile, a fleeting dawn of warmth,  
                   A gentle sunbeam in the morning’s hush,  
                   Its light dances on the canvas of his face,  
                   A silent symphony, a tender brush.
                   <br>
                   In its curve, the secrets of joy unfold,  
                   Soft whispers of dreams, tender and bold,  
                   A beacon in the shadows, bright and clear,  
                   A promise of laughter, a solace near.
                   <br>
                   It lingers like a sunlit breeze on a spring day,  
                   A timeless melody in the world’s grand play,  
                   His smile—a treasure, pure and bright,  
                   A glimpse of the stars in the velvet night.</div>
